This event continues to get more popular each year and we are thrilled by the public enthusiasm for the event. From the past yearsâ€™ experience, we anticipate more than a 200 participants and a 1000 to be entertained this year.


You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
