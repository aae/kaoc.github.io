Welcome to the website of Kerala Association of Colorado (**KAOC**).  
I am excited to be a part of the tradition that our parents have bestowed upon us for years. 

I hope to be able to continue the tradition of the Kerala Association of Colorado (**KAOC**) and to be at least half as successful as the committees from the years past. It is my mission to help create a larger interest within our youth and young adults of Colorado with our culture through the Kerala Association.  

With this goal in mind, this yearâ€™s committee will strive to create new events that will peak the interest of the younger generation.

Our mission is to provide a forum to exhibit cultural diversity through the creation, performance, and appreciation of arts.

**Thanks**,  
**Thomas John**
